[Header("Documentation Hub")]
This is our Documents, A hub of sorts to reference other documents on simpler items and to have it more broken down then in here
to put it simply, this area is all about learning, and documenting what we learn, in order to learn more efficently.

--->Key:
"<---" = Important
"<--" = Noted
"->" = Item of value
"-->" = Main topic for items
"--->" = Area key
"\YourShit/DocIG\" = Reference

--->Tasks:
<---"rework bosses, take examples from either wof or deerclops, since they have something special."
<--- "Finish doing up the Forgotten Cultists loot"
<-- "Finish off Pre Hardmode Progression"
<--- "Document all we've already done"

--->Ideas
<--"Forgotten Cultist Loot Ideas. 1, Relic(self-explanitory). 2, Lunar Shards(can be used to craft up some shit.<Also gives the change to
learn armour/vanity, spriting>). 3, Small Megolathin Soul(A soul upgrade exclusive to post-hardmode). 4, Key to The Endless Void(A Key that sets
Post-Hardmode on usage.)"

---> Specific topics are regarded to in lower the lower sections, and most likely are reference for other documents.

--> Bosses/Boss Reworking

<-- To be put simply, this section will entertain the idea of creating bosses and reworking existing vanilla bosses.

\Documentation/Basics/Reworks\
<--- ^ has everything about reworking.
